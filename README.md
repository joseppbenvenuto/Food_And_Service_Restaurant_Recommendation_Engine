# Food_And_Service_Restaurant_Recommendation_Engine

## Project Description

The analysis explored the Yelp business reviews data set https://www.yelp.com/dataset. 

Filtering for only restaurants and culinary businesses in Toronto, topic modeling was used to cluster data and mine for service-standard reviews. Once the clusters had been generated, single value decomposition (SVD) was used to create two recommendation engines. One engine for all standard-based reviews (service and food) and another for food standard-based reviews. 

Having completed the above, a recommendation dashboard app using plotly and dash was created. The dashboard allows the user to have the choice if he/she wants to be recommended restaurants basis all standards or simply basis food standards. 

Anyone looking to explore and get a deeper look into Toronto's restaurants can use this app.

## Methods Used

1) Descriptive Statistics - used for preliminary data exploration.
2) Topic Modeling - Used to cluster reviews by their context
3) Single Value Decomposition (SVD) - used to create 2 restaurant recommendation engines basis all standards or food standards 

## Results 

### Descriptive stats after cleaning and data preprocessing 

* **number of businesses** - 911
* **number of users** - 4,045
* **number of reviews** - 100,763

### Topic modeling

Topics:



* **Topic0 AKA Topic1** - Service
* **Topic1 AKA Topic1** - Food
* **Topic2 AKA Topic1** - Food
* **Topic3 AKA Topic1** - Food

All topics generated represented the reviews they were asigned to by proportions greater then >= 50% 67% of the time.
